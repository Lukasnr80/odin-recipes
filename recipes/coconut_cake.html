<h3>Description</h3>
<p>At the request of many readers, let me introduce you to the best coconut cake I’ve ever had. Homemade with love for coconut lovers everywhere, this cake exceeds my expectations. Complete with silky coconut cream cheese buttercream, she’s absolutely perfect and juxtaposes bold flavor with a light crumb.</p>
<p>I endlessly tested this cake recipe. In fact, I’m pretty sure my head turned into an actual coconut during the process. Is there shredded coconut caked into the crevices of my kitchen floor and backsplash? Yes.</p>
<h3>Ingredients</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Cake Flour</li>
    <li>Egg Whites</li>
    <li>Sour Cream</li>
    <li>Coconut Extract</li>
    <li>Canned Coconut Milk</li>
    <li>Vanilla</li>
</ul>    

<h3>Steps</h3>
<ol>
    <li>Cool cakes completely. Sounds obvious, but even the tiniest bit of warmth will melt the frosting. As a result, the layer cake will slip, slide, or even cave in!</li>
    <li>f your cakes have a dome on top, level them off with a cake leveler or serrated knife. Flat-topped cakes ensure a straight and sturdy layer cake.</li>
    <li>Choose a serving plate or cake stand. Here is the cake stand I use in these pictures!</li>
    <li>Place the bottom layer on the cake stand. Using an icing spatula, spread 1 and 1/2 cups of frosting in an even layer on top. Bring the frosting just over the edge of the cake; this will be helpful when it’s time to frost the sides.</li>
    <li>Place the second layer top-side-down on top. Make sure it aligns with the bottom cake layer.</li>
    <li>Spread 1 and 1/2 cups frosting evenly on top, just as you did with the bottom layer.</li>
    <li>Place third layer top-side-up on top. Again, make sure it’s perfectly aligned.</li>
    <li>Divide the remaining frosting in half. (Just eyeball it.) Dollop half of the frosting on top of the cake and use an icing spatula to smooth it to the edges. Apply *some* of the remaining frosting all around the sides of the cake, then use a bench scraper to smooth it in a thin layer. Apply the rest of the frosting on the sides of the cake, then bench scrape to smooth it all out.</li>
